# Region configuration.
#
# Here's some important gotchas:
#
# - Each region must start with its unique key (if there are duplicate keys,
#   only the last one of the duplicate regions would be loaded)
#
# - Each region must have all the required fields: name, type and corners or center and radius.
#   If some required field is missing, the region won't be loaded. (error message will be logged).
#
# - Any additional parameters can be supplied. All the dynmap area params are supported: fillcolor, opacity, fillopacity, weight
#   (if not defined, dynmap default values are used. See https://github.com/webbukkit/dynmap/wiki/Using-markers for more info)
#
# - Rectangle-type regions must have exactly two corners: top left and bottom right (from dynmap POV)
#
# - Circle regions must have a center and a radius.
#
# - Polygons must have at least 3 corners. Use the rectangle type instead of polygon if the area is rectangular.
#
# - When defining corners for a polygonal region, it is important that the corner points are ordered clock-wise.
#   Z goes down in dynmap coordinates, which means that from dynmap POV the corners go COUNTER-clock-wise.
#
# - Subregions: a region can be inside another region. In that case, the subregion should specify its parent
#   in the field 'subregionof'. Example: subregionof: "exampleParent", where "exampleParent" is the key of the parent region.
#   Note that the subregion should be completely inside its parent. If it overlaps only partially, the non-overlapping part
#   wont be considered when checking the region of a location.
#   Finally, subregions currently cannot have subregions of their own.
#
# (delete the examples below)

example: # unique key
  name: "Example triangle region"
  dimension: "world" # overworld. Check the world names of your server in the server folder.
  color: "ff0000" # Color used in chat messages and for dynmap area borders
  fillcolor: "ff0000" # Color for dynmap area fill
  opacity: "0.3" # Dynmap border opacity
  fillopacity: "0.3" # Dynmap fill opacity. If zero, the area is not clickable
  weight: "0.3" # Dynmap border weight
  type: "polygon" # either 'polygon', 'circle' or 'rectangle'
  corners: # polygon corners must be ordered CLOCK-WISE
    - {x: 0, z: 0}
    - {x: 0, z: 10}
    - {x: 10, z: 10}

circleExample: # unique key
  name: "Example circle"
  dimension: "world_nether"
  color: "00ff00"
  type: "circle"
  center:
    x: 123
    y: 234
  radius: 32

subRegionExample: # this region is inside "example"
  name: "Example subregion"
  subregionof: "example" # refers to the region with key "example"
  color: "00ff00"
  type: "circle"
  center:
    x: 3
    y: 3
  radius: 3

rectangleExample:
  name: "A rectangle"
  type: "rectangle"
  corners: # Rectangles must have exactly two corners: first the top left corner and then the bottom right corner
    - {x: 50, z: -10}
    - {x: 100, z: 10}
