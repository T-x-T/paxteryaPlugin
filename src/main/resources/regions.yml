# Region configuration.
#
# Here's some important gotchas:
#
# - Each region must start with its unique key (if there are duplicate keys,
#   only the last one of the duplicate regions would be loaded)
#
# - Each region must have all the required fields: name, type and corners or center and radius.
#   If some required field is missing, the region won't be loaded. (error message will be logged)
#   Fields dimension and color are optional with defaults 'world' and '#ffffff' respectively.
#
# - When defining corners for a polygonal region, it is important that the corner points are ordered clock-wise.
#
# - Regions should not overlap. This will cause undefined behaviour.
#   (Overlapping regions with priorities may be implemented in the future)
#
# (delete the examples below)

example: # unique key
  name: "Example triangle region"
  dimension: "world" # overworld. Check the world names of your server in the server folder.
  color: "#ff0000"
  type: "polygon" # either 'polygon' or 'circle'
  corners: # polygon corners must be ordered CLOCK-WISE
    - {x: 0, z: 0}
    - {x: 0, z: 10}
    - {x: 10, z: 10}

circleExample: # unique key
  name: "Example circle"
  dimension: "world_nether"
  color: "#00ff00"
  type: "circle"
  center:
    x: 123
    y: 234
  radius: 32
